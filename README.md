# To Implement BERT in C


## The aim is to be familiar to c and learn all the foundation to the llm.

By Following [llm.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c), I am gonna try to implement BERT in C.



# TODO:

- [x] Implement BERT in Python using PyTorch.
- [x] Load BERT pretrained weight and verify the output.
- [x] Save Input and Output of every layer of python model, to verify the result in c.
- [x] Implement BERT Embedding in C, verify the result with python output.
- [x] Implement Layer Normalizaging in Python and C.

## Encoders:
- [ ] Implement Self Attention in Python and C and verify the result using embedding out as input.
